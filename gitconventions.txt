Once you have all sorted out the basics of git and have it working on your machine,
we try and abide but these few basics.

The general git workflow may look something like this:
1) git pull
2) make any edits
3) git add *    to stage changes to all files or git add x    where x is the specific file you changed. 
4) git commit -m ""     where, in between the quotes, you write whatever changes you made.
    
    ****NOTE**** : we will use the imperative tense when writing comit messages. For example, suppose you wrote a
    function called add_one(), you might write something like "Write a function called add_one which ...."

5) git push
